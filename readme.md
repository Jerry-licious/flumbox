* *Group of Jerry (Bokuan) Li (Jerry#7671), Yichen Dou (GlacierAndStarfruit#3173), and Doddy Yang Qiu (DONT DIE THANK YOU#9747)*

**DESCRIPTION:** 
	Our group focuses on designing/creating a 2D-Minigame runnable on browser. 
* *GamePlay:*
	The goal of the game is to get a square situated in an enclosed area to the goal.
	However, the player does not directly control the ball. All that the player can do is to 
	turn gravity on/off and rotate the canvas CCW or CW by 90 degree (i.e. rotate all other elements other than the player in the level)
* *Technologies:*	
	In this project, we used HTML5 and CSS3 for Displaying the Webpage. 
	Vanilla Javascript, Canvas API and Matter.js API are used to create the game.
	The game is best runned on Google Chrome, full screen on a 1080p monitor.
	We used github to manage updates and Sublime text and Webstorm as IDEs.
* *Challenges:* The biggest challenge our group has to face is the Matter.js API, which none of us have any idea of how it function before Marihack. Being able to learn and use it within a restrained time period is both challenging and rewarding.
